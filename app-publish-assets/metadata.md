## Full Description (4000 characters max)

ExoHunter AI brings the power of exoplanet discovery to your fingertips. Built for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025, this application combines artificial intelligence with real NASA mission data to help users explore and analyze planets beyond our solar system.

### Explore Thousands of Exoplanets

Access a comprehensive database of over 5,000 confirmed exoplanets discovered by NASA's Kepler and TESS missions. Browse detailed information about each planet including size, mass, orbital period, distance from Earth, host star characteristics, and habitability potential. Filter discoveries by detection method, planet type, habitable zone classification, and discovery year.

### AI-Powered Analysis Tools

Upload and analyze telescope light curve data using machine learning algorithms. The AI detection engine processes observational data to identify potential exoplanet candidates through the transit method. Receive detailed analysis results including planet characteristics, confidence scores, and visual representations of detected transit signals.

### Interactive 3D Visualization

Experience immersive 3D models of planetary systems. Explore accurate orbital mechanics, compare planet sizes with familiar solar system objects, and visualize habitable zones around host stars. Interactive controls allow you to rotate, zoom, and examine planetary systems from any angle.

### Educational Learning Center

Access comprehensive astronomy resources including interactive tutorials on exoplanet detection methods, detailed glossary of astronomical terms, guide to understanding light curves and transit photometry, and information about different types of exoplanets and detection techniques. Learn about habitability factors and the search for life beyond Earth.

### Personal Discovery Dashboard

Track your analysis history and discoveries. View statistics on your contributions, earn achievement badges for milestones, and monitor your progress in learning modules. Compare your results with the community and see global discovery trends.

### Real NASA Data Integration

Work with authentic data from NASA's Kepler Space Telescope mission, TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) observations, and the NASA Exoplanet Archive. All planetary data is sourced from verified scientific databases and updated regularly.
